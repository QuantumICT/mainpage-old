## **Research Experience**

### **High-Performance Variational Quantum Monte Carlo Solver Based on Matrix Product States**  
**Aug 2023 - Present**  
- Proposed a variational quantum Monte Carlo algorithm based on matrix product states and designed an efficient sampling algorithm using binary/quadtree autoregressive sampling.
- Implemented local energy calculations based on the Slater-Condon rule, time-dependent variational principle algorithms, and non-random configuration selection algorithms in variational quantum Monte Carlo to accelerate convergence.
- Leveraged PyTorch framework for network inference and GPU acceleration with automatic differentiation.

### **Scalable and Differentiable Quantum Chemistry Simulator Based on Matrix Product States**  
**Aug 2022 - Aug 2023**  
- Addressed the memory consumption issue of automatic differentiation in tensor network-based quantum simulators by designing a quantum circuit backpropagation algorithm with low memory consumption, requiring at most two quantum state copies during the forward process, independent of the number of quantum circuit parameters.
- Proposed a method to partition quantum chemistry Hamiltonians to parallelize the backpropagation process, achieving 87%/99% strong/weak scalability efficiency with 100 qubits and 3000 processes.

### **Large-Scale Scalable Quantum Chemistry Simulator Based on Matrix Product States**  
**Nov 2021 - Aug 2022**  
- Employed matrix product states as the backend for quantum circuit simulators in variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) to overcome the exponential memory bottleneck of state vector simulators. Designed a numerically stable single/double quantum gate evolution process, allowing the simulator to simulate deeper circuits.
- Developed a parallel circuit evolution algorithm based on VQE quantum circuit characteristics, scaling to 20 million cores on the Sunway supercomputer with 92%/91% strong/weak scalability efficiency.
